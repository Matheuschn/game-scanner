  Game Scanner
</h1>
Game Scanner is a way to run simple games directly from a QR Code, without need for an internet connection.

# How it works?
The app expects to read a QR Code containing simple JS code, which will then be executed. The app is built using React Native and Typescript.

# Install
To build the app, follow the steps:
  1. Run `yarn install`
  2. Run `yarn run android`
